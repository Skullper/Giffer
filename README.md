Nothing important, just learning kotlin

My first project in Kotlin. The purpose of project was creating gifs from captured video, 
uploading gif file to admin panel and share the gif link to friends. Unfortunaly project was closed. 
But I'm happy anyway because this was my chance to try kotlin in real project
